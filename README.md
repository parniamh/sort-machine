# 🔢 Number Sorter — My First Sorting Algorithm in C#  
A beginner-friendly Windows Forms app that sorts ten user-entered numbers  
Built as part of my hands-on journey into arrays, loops, and interactive UI design ✨  

## 💡 What it does  
Enter ten numbers into the form’s textboxes and click “Sort”—  
The app uses a nested loop to reorder them in ascending order!  
After sorting, click “Show” to re-display the sorted list back into the form.  

## 🎯 Why it matters  
This was my first exploration into array manipulation and sorting logic.  
It helped me understand how UI input connects to algorithmic computation.  

## 🔧 Technologies used  
💻 Language: C#  
🖥️ Framework: Windows Forms  
🛠️ Environment: Visual Studio
